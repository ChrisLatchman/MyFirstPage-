  <h3>About Me:</h3>  
    <p>Hi my name is Chris I'm 20 years old and I live in the bronx with my parents and my brother. I am currently majoring in multimedia and I love it whether it's building a website,editing,shooting a video,animation,photograhy, etc... I've always been fascinated by it and hope to run my own multimedia business one day. I'm the kind of person thats always ready to learn new things media, life or anything really I'm also into music it's my get away for when I'm stressed out or having a bad day I would just start practicing. What mean the most to me is my family parents,brother,aunts,uncles and cousins they are my ride or die. My motto is "Can't just sit around waiting for opportunities to come knocing at your door cause it ain't gonna happen".</p>
